# Copilot Guardrails
# Do not rewrite explicit `if/else` blocks into ternary expressions.
# Preserve existing `else` blocks exactly as authored.
# No stylistic rewrites of conditionals without explicit user request.
# Prioritise creating test files as opposed to writing complex multiline code in the terminal
# Avoid using cmdand heredoc in the terminal

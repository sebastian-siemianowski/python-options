High RevPAR, for purposes of our investment strategy, means RevPAR of at least twice the then-current U.S. national average RevPAR for all hotels as determined by STR, LLC. Two times the U.S. national average was $199 for the year ended December 31, 2024. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. We conduct our business and own substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership, Braemar OP. We operate in the direct hotel investment segment of the hotel lodging industry. As of September 30, 2025, we owned interests in 14 hotel properties in six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands with 3,438 total rooms, or 3,298 net rooms, excluding those attributable to our joint venture partner. The hotel properties in our current portfolio are predominantly located in U.S. urban markets and resort locations with favorable growth characteristics resulting from multiple demand generators. We own 13 of our hotel properties directly and one hotel property through an investment in a majority-owned consolidated entity. We are advised by Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC through an advisory agreement. Ashford LLC is a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. All of the hotel properties in our portfolio are currently asset-managed by Ashford LLC. We do not have any employees. All of the services that might be provided by employees are provided to us by Ashford LLC. We do not operate any of our hotel properties directly; instead, we contractually engage hotel management companies to operate them for us under management contracts. As of September 30, 2025, Remington Hospitality, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., managed five of our 14 hotel properties. Third-party management companies managed the remaining hotel properties. Ashford Inc. also provides other products and services to us or our hotel properties through certain entities in which Ashford Inc. has an ownership interest. These products and services include, but are not limited to, design and construction services, debt placement and related services, broker-dealer and distribution services, audio visual services, real estate advisory and brokerage services, insurance policies covering general liability, workers compensation and business automobile claims, insurance claims services, hypoallergenic premium rooms, watersport activities, travel/transportation services and cash management services.", "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Montgomery Jack Bennett IV", "age": 59, "title": "Founder & Chairman of the Board", "yearBorn": 1966, "fiscalYear": 2024, "totalPay": 2367347, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Richard J.
